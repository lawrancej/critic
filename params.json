Pretty straightforward!  \r\nTry it at [b3ngr33ni3r.github.com/critic](http://b3ngr33ni3r.github.io/critic).\r\n\r\n## How's it work?\r\n\r\nIt's written in __javascript__, with a __node__ backend. This means critic runs in the browser.\r\n\r\n## Is it easy to setup?\r\n\r\nYes and no. If you want to __run a node server__, you can just `npm install critic` (maybe, if i can secure this name). Then, `npm start` and fill\r\nout the command line prompts (github app info, callback url, etc). You'll only be prompted for this on the first launch, upon which we create\r\na json or yaml config file. This will be used for the next launches.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Licensing?\r\n\r\nSharing is caring... It's the [MIT License](./blob/master/LICENSE). Questions? Open an issue, or tweet at me!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
