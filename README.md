# DEV BRANCH


> Critic is a node application, which means you need to be able to run node to deploy it!

code review tool - integrated tightly with github

## What is it?

Critic is a combination of stumbleupon for github code, and crowdranker. The aim of the project is to allow
(anonymous) code review in a classroom enviroment. __That being said__, Critic also works great for any sort
of random code review (ie: get thrown some code, review it).

## Example

You can play with critic at [critic.bengreenier.com](http://critic.bengreenier.com), and get a feel for what
it can (and can't) do.
> Note that this instance of critic uses a memory store, meaning that user data disappears when the app restarts.
