# DEV BRANCH


code review tool - integrated tightly with github

## What is it?

It's a tool that allows users to review other's code. Pretty straightforward!  
Try it at [critic.b3ngr33ni3r.com](http://critic.b3ngr33ni3r.com).

## How's it work?

Critic is a web app! It's written in node and as such, requires node to run an instance.

## Is it easy to setup?

Hell yes. _more on this later_.

## Licensing?

Sharing is caring... It's the [MIT License](./blob/master/LICENSE). Questions? Open an issue, or [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/b3ngr33ni3r)!
